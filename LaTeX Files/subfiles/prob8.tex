\numbpr{8}
\prob{8}  This \textbf{MAC} is \emph{not} secure because it \textbf{XOR}s the 'tags' for each message block instead of \textbf{XOR}ing all of the blocks together and then generating a tag from that result.  This is a problem because it does not prevent an adversary from changing the order of any of the blocks.
